Determine whether students are ready to take CSCE 629, so they can decide whether to sign up.

Getting started
To get started with the app, clone the repo and then install the needed gems in superuser mode:
$ sudo su
# rvm use 2.3.1
# bundle install --without production
# exit

Next, apply database migrations to both the dev and test databases:
$ rvm use 2.3.1
$ bundle exec rake db:migrate
$ bundle exec rake db:migrate RAILS_ENV=test
$ bundle exec rake db:seed

If seed aborted, try
$ bundle exec rake db:reset

Run rspec and cucumber tests to make sure everything is working:
$ rspec
$ cucumber

If the tests pass, you'll be ready to run the app in a local server:
$ rails server -p $PORT -b $IP

For Amazon AWS users: if app link dosen't show up,
On the top bar, click 'Preview' -> 'Preview Running Application'. This will open the built-in browser with empty display. 
Copy the URL from the browser, paste in your chrome or IE browser. Or click 'Pop Out Into New Window' next to the URL.
You should see the application loaded there.
